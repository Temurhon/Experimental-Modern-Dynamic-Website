  <p>Hey, you may not know me, but you will. My name is Temurhon Kamariddinov. I have been in this country for more than 5 years and i still have something that surprises me about london to this day. When i was a kid. I was inspired by comic book characters like wolverine, spiiderman and batman. These cahracters mean a lot to me and have impacted me throughout my life as a kid. Even to this day, I still pray to myself in order to keep the tension off. I am very shy in person but when i get to know you it will be a very different story becuase i tend to getvery personal and truthful.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, i usually go for a run, have a session on online intense gaming and also photography. I fell in love with photography when i was 17. I liked the idea of creativity and art form of photography. It felt as if i was painting or drawing. It opened my mind to so many new possibilaties and other things. I met a lot of young inspired people that to this day become my friends. It is a really good gateway to open your eyes for new opportunies </p>
